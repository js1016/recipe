This action plan captures logs to reveal how Edge parses the site list and loads a site in IE mode. It will capture:
1. `IEDigest` log includes basic system information and Edge/IE settings.
2. `Process Monitor` log reveals how Edge reads the policy, processes the site list and invokes sub IE process.
3. `Fiddler` trace shows the HTTP traffic generated by different processes.
4. `Edge dual engine log` shows detailed Edge debug log.
5. `Edge Policy` applied Edge policies.
6. `IE mode configuration and diagnostic data` shows currently site list in use and basic IE mode disagnostic information.
