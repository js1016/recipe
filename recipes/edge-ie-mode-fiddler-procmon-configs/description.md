This action plan is typically used when a website behaves unexpectedly in the IE Mode of Edge, as compared to the the native IE browser.

If the unexpected behavior is also observed in the native IE browser, you should follow the instructions in the [IE Fiddler, Process Monitor, IEDigest](https://edgedbg.com/recipe/ie-fiddler-procmon) to capture logs in the native IE browser.

If a site that is supposed to load in IE mode does not load properly in IE mode, you may need to refer to: [Edge IE mode - Fiddler, Process Monitor, Dual-engine log and configurations](https://edgedbg.com/recipe/edge-ie-mode-fiddler-procmon-dualengine-configs)
