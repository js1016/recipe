This action plan captures logs to reveal how Edge parses the site list and loads a site in IE mode. It will capture:

1. `IEDigest` log, which includes basic system information and Edge/IE settings.
2. `Process Monitor` log, which reveals how Edge reads the policy, processes the site list and invokes sub-IE process.
3. `Fiddler` trace, which shows the HTTP traffic generated by different processes.
4. `Edge dual engine log, which shows detailed Edge debug information.
5. `Edge Policy`, which shows applied Edge policies.
6. `IE mode configuration and diagnostic data`, which shows currently used site list and basic IE mode disagnostic information.
