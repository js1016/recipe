1. When you want to end the Time Travel recording, untick the checkbox next to **Tracing On** in the small window at the upper left corner. The Time Travel trace will be saved in the directory where `tttracer.exe` is currently executed by default. You can find the full path of this trace in the CMD where the command is executed.
