1. Run CMD as an administrator. Based on your operating system type, change directory (CD) to the following paths:

    - For 32-bit systems: `C:\ttd\x86`
    - For 64-bit systems: `C:\ttd\amd64`
    - For ARM64 systems: `C:\ttd\arm64`

    **Note**: If you have extracted the `ttd.zip` file to a different directory, replace `C:\ttd` with your actual extraction path.
