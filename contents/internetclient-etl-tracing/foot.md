1. Go to the elevated command prompt or PowerShell where you started the InternetClient ETL tracing and run command `netsh trace stop` to stop tracing.
2. It may take some time to merge traces. Please wait until you see message: "**Tracing session was successfully stopped**" and then please gather the output files: `c:\temp\internetclient.etl` and `c:\temp\internetclient.cab`.
