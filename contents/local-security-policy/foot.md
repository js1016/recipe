1. Run CMD or PowerShell as an administrator and execute the following command:

    ```
    SecEdit.exe /export /cfg security-policy.inf
    ```

    You can find the exported file: `security-policy.inf` in the current working directory. For example, if you executed the above command in `c:\temp`, the file will be located at: `c:\temp\security-policy.inf`.
