1. Run CMD as an administrator, navigate to the `C:\temp\NotMyFault` directory, and execute the following command: `notmyfault64.exe /crash` (if your system is 32-bit, execute `notmyfault.exe /crash`; if the system is ARM64, execute `notmyfault64a.exe /crash`). This command will trigger your Windows system crash, and you will see a blue screen. At this point, the system is creating a complete dump and will then restart.
