1. Launch a Command Prompt as administrator and navigate (CD) to the folder where you saved `wfp-trace.bat`. Then run the following command: `wfp-trace.bat`.

2. Wait until you see the message `Reproduce your issue and enter any key to stop tracing`. **DO NOT** press any key, just minimize the command prompt and proceed to reproduce whatever symptom you want to demonstrate.
