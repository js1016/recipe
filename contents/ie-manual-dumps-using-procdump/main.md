Once IE is in a not responding state or in the state that you want to capture the dump of, immediately double click on the `CaptureIEDumps.vbs` file located in the folder where you have extracted the `CaptureIEDumps.zip`. A prompt for elevated permission will appear, and then it will capture 3 full memory dumps for all running IE processes.
